#  name: Spectral inference of IGRINS data
#  description: >
#    IGRINS is a high resolution (R~40,000) spectrograph covering the entire H- and K- near-IR spectral windows in a single exposure.  This immense spectral grasp presents both a new scientific competitive advantage, and an analysis challenge.  I am leveraging a new statistical and computational approach that emulates synthetic spectra from pre-computed stellar model grid to compare with IGRINS data.  The implementation of this approach, Starfish, is openly developed on GitHub, parallelized, and permissively licensed.  The code provides an extensible modular framework for deriving intrinsic and extrinsic stellar properties.  My work is centered around extending the code to model new astrophysical phenomena surrounding young stars.

#  name: Discovery and characterization of young brown dwarfs
#  description: >
#    Brown dwarfs are rare.  The dearth of brown dwarfs is a manifestation of the stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF).  Their rarity and the observational challenges of detecting them have conspired to yield small samples of brown dwarfs.  Despite these limitations, brown dwarfs offer a unique astrophysical laboratory, to which we can ask the question "how do circumstellar disks change as a function of central object mass".  Or radiation environoment.  Or gravitational potential.  Etc.  The agregate properties of young brown dwarfs can reveal how astrophysical processes govern star formation. For example, weâ€™re learning about circumstellar disk dispersal timescales as a function of central object mass. These ideas ultimately inform our understanding of planetary habitability, and the diversity of stellar and planetary systems.

#  name: Silicon Immersion gratings 
#  description: >
#    The Jaffe Silicon Diffractive Optics Group has been making diffraction gratings out of monocrystalline silicon.  Silicon is an excellent optical material in the infrared because of its high (_n_ = 3.4) refractive index, which shrinks Si immersed wavelength, and reduces the overall size of an infrared spectrograph design by a factor of about 3 to 10.  Weisong Wang and I custom-made the Si immersion grating for IGRINS.

#  name: AstroML meetup and textbook figure hacking
#  description: >
#    Some of us were getting together to do examples from the AstroML textbook, "Statistics, Data Mining, and Machine Learning in Astronomy: A Practical Python Guide to the Analysis of Survey Data".  This book is the killer app for self-education in Machine Learning for Astronomy, and was (for better or worse) how I taught myself Python.  The [Python source code for every single figure in the book](http://www.astroml.org/book_figures/) is online (we love you [Jake](https://twitter.com/jakevdp)).  I hacked some of the textbook figures and [posted them online too](http://gully.github.io/astroMLfigs/).

#  name: They Blinded Me with Science
#  description: >
#    I kickstarted a science podcast for the KVRX science radio show *They Blinded Me With Science*.  I produced 30 original podcasts with > 3000 collective downloads and plays (and counting).  The 30-minute show typically centered around researchers from the UT Austin College of Natural Sciences or beyond.  Guests included Jeff Silverman, Rachael Livermore, [Klaus Pontoppidan](http://tbmws.podbean.com/e/monday-february-17-2014-astronomer-klaus-pontoppidan-educates-us-about-planet-formation/), and Chalence Safranek-Shrader, among others.  All the podcasts are on iTunes!

#  name: Interactive Physics of Spectroscopy installation at UT Austin
#  description: >
#    I designed and installed this public outreach installation for the UT Austin Department of Astronomy.  The exhibit is on the Astronomy Department's 15th floor in Robert Lee Moore Hall.  A large glass display case holds a hydrogen spectrum tube, Raspberry Pi micro-computer, web-camera, diffraction grating, and computer monitor.  An arcade-style button triggers the Raspberry Pi to turn on the monitor, camera, and Hydrogen spectrum tube to show a live spectrum to any curious students or visitors passing by.  The button gets clicked on average of 6 times per day.
